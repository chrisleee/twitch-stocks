# Development

## Getting Started

Firstly, check out the project's [Roadmap](https://github.com/ChrisALee/twitch-stocks/wiki/Roadmap) and [issues](https://github.com/ChrisALee/twitch-stocks/issues).

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js").

I recommend using Node Version Manager: [Linux/macOS](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)  [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

2. Fork the repo.

3. Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChrisALee/twitch-stocks.git

cd twitch-stocks/client
```

5. Run NPM install. This will give you all the dependencies needed to locally run the project.

```
npm install
