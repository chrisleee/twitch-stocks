# Twitch Stocks
Twitch Stocks allows you to invest in Twitch streamers using virtual points. (No money involved)

Say your favorite streamer averages 20,000 viewers one week and you invest in them.
The next week they managed to bump their average viewer count to 22,000. You just profited!
Maybe you're feeling risky and want to invest in a low-viewer streamer in the hopes that they blow up in viewership.

### Everything, such as using viewer count as value, is tentative at this point.

# Development

### Getting Started

Firstly, check out the project's [Roadmap](https://github.com/ChrisALee/twitch-stocks/wiki/Roadmap) and [issues](https://github.com/ChrisALee/twitch-stocks/issues).

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js").

I recommend using Node Version Manager: [Linux/macOS](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)  [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

2. Fork the repo.

3. Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChrisALee/twitch-stocks.git
```

4. Navigate to the directory (twitch-stocks by default).

```
cd twitch-stocks
```

5. Run NPM install. This will give you all the dependencies needed to locally run the project.

```
npm install
```

6. Run the project.

```
npm run dev
```

7. Go to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

Any contributions are appreciated.

### Learning Resources

#### Next.js: 
* [Learn Next.js](https://learnnextjs.com/ "Learn Nextjs") - I'd suggest to start here.
* [Next.js examples](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/v3-beta/examples "Next.js examples") - Treat this as a reference for figuring out how to do certain tasks or integrate other tools with Next.js.

#### React:
* [Eric Douglas' curated list of React resources](https://github.com/ericdouglas/react-learning) - I'd look at React, ES2015+, Redux, and Bundlers. Just be aware that we're using Next.js, so some stuff like routing is abstracted away. If you went through Learn Next.js, you might be able to spot the differences.

#### Node.js/Express:
* [Build a RESTful API Using Node and Express](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4) - This tutorial is from 2014, so be aware that some things might possibly be outdated.

#### MongoDB:
* [Node.js MongoDB Tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/node-js-mongodb.html)
* [Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications)

#### Typescript:
* [Learn Typescript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) - Ignore the parts about installing and compiling since that's already set up with our project.
* [Learn Typescript with React](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) - I'd recommend knowing the basics of React from previous resources before trying to understand this.
* [Typescript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html)
* [Typescript React examples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html) - Folder structure in these examples will differ from ours. I'd look at how the specific components are written rather than any outer index/app files.
